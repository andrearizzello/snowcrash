# Steps

1) Run `./level09` with as many `a` as you want, you will see that you get something like `abcdefghi...` so it means that the character are shifted by the number of their position starting from 0
2) If we reverse the method we can get the token for the user `flag09` (use the script provided)
3) Use the token to login as `flag09` and run `getflag`
